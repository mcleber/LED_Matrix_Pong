## Overview

This project revisits a minimalist **Pong-style arcade game** built with an Arduino Uno and an 8×8 LED matrix driven by the MAX7219.

Originally developed as an early learning exercise, it has now been refactored with improved structure, cleaner organization, enhanced readability, and a redesigned game-over animation.

The paddle is controlled via a potentiometer, while the ball physics are implemented using discrete position updates combined with deterministic collision detection logic.

Beyond being a compact arcade implementation, the project demonstrates several core embedded systems concepts:

- Analog-to-Digital Conversion (ADC) for real-time input acquisition  
- Deterministic control logic for interactive systems  
- Collision detection in constrained environments  
- SPI-based communication with the MAX7219 LED driver  
- Dynamic difficulty adjustment through timing control

The MAX7219 simplifies LED matrix control by handling multiplexing internally and communicating through a SPI-like interface.

## How It Works

The game logic follows a structured embedded architecture:

- Read paddle position using ADC
- Update ball position based on direction vector
- Detect collisions (walls and paddle)
- Render updated frame
- Adjust difficulty by increasing ball speed
- Trigger animation when game over

---

## Features

- Modular firmware architecture
- Increasing difficulty over time
- Game-over animation
- Clean and optimized rendering logic
- Lightweight and hardware-efficient

---

## Future Improvements

- Score system
- Non-blocking timing using millis()
- Sound feedback (buzzer)
- Two-player mode
- Angle variation based on paddle impact
